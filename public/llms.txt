# Retirement Tax Plan Context

## Project Description
Retirement Tax Plan is a free, privacy-focused tax estimation tool for retirees. It allows users to:
- Compare 2025 vs 2026 Federal tax liabilities.
- Optimize income stacking strategies (Ordinary Income vs. Capital Gains).
- Estimate Social Security taxation using the Provisional Income formula.

## Core Concepts
- **Income Stacking**: The order of withdrawals (Standard Deduction -> Ordinary Income -> Capital Gains).
- **Provisional Income**: The formula used to determine taxable Social Security benefits.
- **TCJA Expiration**: The potential revert to pre-2018 tax rates in 2026.

## Architecture
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Privacy**: Client-side only data processing. No database.
