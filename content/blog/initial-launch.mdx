# Launching the Retirement Tax Plan Calculator

We are excited to introduce the Retirement Tax Plan calculator, a specialized tool designed to help retirees navigate the complexities of US Federal Taxes.

## Why we built this

Retirement tax planning is notoriously difficult because of "tax drag" from various income sources. The interplay between Social Security taxation, Long-Term Capital Gains brackets, and the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) creates a complex puzzle.

## Key Features

1.  **Income Stacking Visualization**: See exactly how your Ordinary Income sits at the bottom and Capital Gains sit on top.
2.  **2025 vs 2026 Comparison**: The TCJA expires at the end of 2025. This tool lets you toggle tax years to see how your liability might change if rates revert to pre-2018 levels.
3.  **Optimization Insights**: The tool automatically calculates how much "room" you have left in your current bracket, enabling precise partial Roth conversions.

## Free and Private

This tool runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to any server. It is free to use and open source.
